<h1>Gabrielle Yurchak</h1>

    <p>
      Hello! I am Gabrielle and these are a few things about me!
      </p>


    <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
    	<p>
        I have several hobbies, such as playing music and playing games on my laptop.
        </p>

    <h3>Daily Life</h3>
    <p>
      <div>
        My daily happenings mostly circle around Girls Who Code at the moment, but when the program is over, I will most likely code in my free time.
        </div>
      <div>
          I spend time with my cats most of the time, and they are the best company.
        </div>
      <p>
    <h3>Vacation Dreams</h3>
    	<p>
        If I could go anywhere on vacation, I would go down the shore and go crabbing with my mother and my dad. I would also bring my two dogs, Ridick and Ryder, along for the ride.
        </p>
